I'm Chad Royal, a (ahem) seasoned survivor of many teams & technologies. I plop down my code here, and plop down my words at [chadsy.lol](https://chadsy.lol).

| Pragmatism in team processes & policies | Embedded devices & systems |
| Random & varied open source projects    | Retro computing & single-board-computers |
| Shipping software                       | Brushing up on the latest C++ standards |
| Assembly language                       | Writing code every day as a code kata |
